    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a dedicated Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in programming and problem-solving. Proficient in C and C++, I have a solid grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which I regularly practice to improve logic-building and coding efficiency. I enjoy applying theoretical concepts to real-world problems and continuously seek to enhance my skills through projects and coding challenges. My passion for technology drives me to explore new tools and frameworks beyond the classroom. I am currently expanding my knowledge in web development while keeping a strong foundation in core programming. With a growth mindset and a love for clean, efficient code, I aim to become a well-rounded software developer in the future. I am a passionate frontend developer with experience in building responsive and user-friendly web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
