DESCRIPTION OF THE TASKS:
COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

The Personal Portfolio Webpage is a simple, attractive, and mobile-friendly website created to introduce myself as a developer. I made this project using only HTML and CSS, without any complex tools. It shows my basic web development skills and helps others know more about me, my projects, and how to contact me. This project is a part of my frontend internship at Codtech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
The main goal of this portfolio website is to present my work and skills in a clean and professional way. It works like an online resume, where anyone can visit and learn about what I do, what technologies I use, and the projects I have built.

Home Section:
This is the welcome section. It shows my name, a short title (like “Web Developer” or “CSE Student”), and a photo. It also has a button like “Download Resume” or “View Projects.”

About Me Section:
This part has a short introduction about me—my education, interests in programming, and goals. It explains who I am and what I enjoy learning.

Skills Section:
This section lists my technical skills like C, C++, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and others. I used progress bars or icons to show the tools and languages I know.

Projects Section:
I added some of my best projects here, like the Quiz App and Chat App. Each project includes a title, a short description, and links to GitHub or live demo (if available).

Contact Section:
This part includes my email, GitHub or a simple contact form so anyone can get in touch with me easily.

By making this portfolio, I improved my skills in HTML and CSS. I learned how to create a layout, add styles, use fonts, colors, and make a website look good on both computers and phones (responsive design). I also practiced how to organize content and give a clear structure to a web page.

This portfolio is very helpful for job opportunities, internships, and college projects. It shows that I can build a full webpage and present my knowledge in a neat and useful way
In short, this Personal Portfolio Webpage is a great way to share my profile and work with the world. It is simple, well-organized, and can be updated in the future with more features like animations, JavaScript, or backend support.
